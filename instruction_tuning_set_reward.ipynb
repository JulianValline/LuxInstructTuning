The original dataset contains 2420 rows, 1930 of which were generated from RTL data and 490 from Wikipedia data. We decided however to only evaluate a subset of 200 randomly sampled entries for helpfulness, correctnes and coherence, using Nvidia-Nemotron-340b-reward. We will sample 80% from the RTL data and 20% from the wiki data, keeping approximately the distribution in the original dataset.
