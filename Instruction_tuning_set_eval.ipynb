We already got the scores for each row from Nvidia Nemotron 340b reward. We want to filter out low quality instruction-answer pairs based on correctness, helpfulness and coherence. We retain these 3 attributes to be the most important ones, as correct information is crucial for fine-tuning LLMs to prevent the generation of misleading or factual inaccurate responses. This will ensure the quality and reliablity of the fine-tuned model. The other important attribute being helpfulness, as the main purpose of LLM's is to assist users. Unhelpful answers, even if correct, are not contributing to the fine-tuning process. Filtering out unhelpful answers ensures that the model learns to generate useful and informative responses. Finally, ensuring coherence makes it that the model not only generates accurate and helpful, but also well-structured and easily followed answers, leading to a better user
